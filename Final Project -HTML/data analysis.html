    <h1>Data Analysis: Artist Gender, Spotify Popularity, and Album Rankings</h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>This project explores the relationship between artist gender, Spotify popularity, and album rankings for the years 2003, 2012, and 2020. We performed various statistical tests (ANOVA, t-tests, Pearsonâ€™s correlation, linear regression) and visualizations (scatterplots, bar plots, boxplots) to analyze these relationships and determine if artist gender or Spotify popularity has an impact on album rankings over time.</p>

    <!-- Data Source -->
    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>The dataset used in this project is publicly available, containing information on album rankings, artist gender, Spotify popularity, and album release years. The data was cleaned and pre-processed before performing any analysis.</p>

    <!-- Data Cleaning -->
    <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p>Before performing any analysis, the dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and filtering irrelevant columns. Necessary transformations were made to prepare the data for statistical testing and visualizations.</p>

    <!-- Analysis Approach -->
    <h2>Analysis Approach</h2>
    <p>The analysis involves the following key steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Statistical Tests</strong>: ANOVA, t-tests, and linear regression were used to test the significance of artist gender, Spotify popularity, and release year on album rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualizations</strong>: Scatterplots, bar plots, and boxplots were used to visually represent the relationships between variables.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Results and Findings -->
    <h2>Results and Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The **mean rank** for male albums in 2020 is 242.34, for female albums is 266.41, for male/female albums is 272.68, and for NA is 451.00.</li>
        <li>The **ANOVA** showed a **p-value of 0.185**, indicating no significant difference in rank based on artist gender.</li>
        <li>The **t-test** confirmed that there is no significant difference in mean rankings between male and female albums, with a p-value of 0.1576.</li>
        <li>The **linear regression** model predicted 2020 album rankings based on Spotify popularity, showing a **significant negative correlation** (r = -0.2215) with a **p-value < 0.05**, suggesting that higher Spotify popularity is associated with worse rankings in 2020.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Visualizations Section -->
    <h2>Visualizations</h2>

    <h3>Scatterplot: Spotify Popularity vs. Rank 2020</h3>
    <img src="scatterplot.png" alt="Scatterplot of Spotify Popularity vs Rank 2020">
    <p>The scatterplot below shows the relationship between Spotify popularity and 2020 rank, with a regression line indicating a weak negative correlation.</p>

    <h3>Boxplot: Rank 2020 by Artist Gender</h3>
    <img src="boxplot.png" alt="Boxplot showing Rank 2020 by Artist Gender">
    <p>This boxplot visualizes the distribution of 2020 ranks for male, female, male/female, and NA artist gender categories.</p>

    <h3>Bar Plot: Mean Rank 2020 by Artist Gender</h3>
    <img src="barplot.png" alt="Bar Plot of Mean Rank 2020 by Artist Gender">
    <p>The bar plot shows the mean rank for each gender category, with male albums having the lowest mean rank in 2020.</p>

    <h3>Histogram: Distribution of Album Release Years</h3>
    <img src="histogram.png" alt="Histogram of Album Release Years">
    <p>This histogram shows the distribution of album release years in the dataset.</p>

    <!-- Code Snippets Section -->
    <h2>Code Snippets</h2>
    <p>Below are key R code snippets used for analysis:</p>
    <pre>
    # Linear regression to predict rank_2020 from spotify_popularity
    lm_result <- lm(rank_2020 ~ spotify_popularity, data = albums)
    summary(lm_result)
    </pre>

    <h3>Statistical Test: t-test</h3>
    <pre>
    # t-test to compare male and female album ranks in 2020
    t_test_result <- t.test(male_albums$rank_2020, female_albums$rank_2020)
    summary(t_test_result)
    </pre>

    <!-- Skills Demonstrated -->
    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data wrangling and cleaning</li>
        <li>Statistical analysis using R (ANOVA, t-test, regression)</li>
        <li>Data visualization with ggplot2</li>
        <li>Interpreting and presenting data insights</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While some relationships were observed between Spotify popularity and 2020 rankings, no significant differences in rankings were found based on artist gender. This suggests that while gender may be a factor in album marketing and perception, it does not significantly influence rankings when compared to other factors like Spotify popularity.</p>
